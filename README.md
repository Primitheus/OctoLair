# OctoLair
Download ROMs Directly on to the TrimUI Smart Pro intended and only tested for ``CrossMix 1.3.0.1``.


## Instructions 
Download the zip from Releases.\
Extract `OctoLair` into `/mnt/SDCARD/Apps`.\
Launch from Apps Menu, Navigate with DPad Buttons, Select with ``B``.
Quit App with ``X``.

## Features
+ Download ROMs into their respective Roms Folder.
+ Queue Downloads.

## Todo
- Hide Unsupported Consoles.
- Implement Themeing Options.
- Unzip ROMs that require it.
- Include Relevant Console and Game Artwork for the UI.
  

## Issues
+ It currently doesn't extract the ROMs from the zip file, so emulators the explicitly require the ROM do not currently run out of the box. e.g PSP.
+ Currently not hiding consoles that the TrimUI doesn't support, downloading games won't work anyway.
