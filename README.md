# OctoLair
Download ROMs from Vimm's Vault directly on to the TrimUI Smart Pro intended and only tested for ``CrossMix 1.3.0.1``.

# Notice
The current state of OctoLair, is quite unsatisfactory for what I am aiming for it to be. It is buggy and tends to crash more often than not (seemingly due to a CrossMix update) and slow download speeds as well as missing key functionality that I am aiming for.
I am planning on refactoring the entire source code (again). There is currently no concrete plans on when the planned major update will happen, but it's coming at some point!

## Instructions 
Download the zip from Releases.\
Extract `OctoLair` into `/mnt/SDCARD/Apps`.\
Launch from Apps Menu.\
Navigate with DPad Buttons.\
Select with ``B``.\
Back with ``A``.\
Quit App with ``X``.\
Extract PS1 & PSP with ``SELECT``.

## Features
+ Download ROMs into their respective Roms Folder.
+ Queue Downloads.
+ Extract ROMs compressed into 7z for PSP & PS1.


## Todo
- Hide Unsupported Consoles.
- Implement Themeing Options.
- Include Relevant Console and Game Artwork for the UI.
- Add Localisation Option.
- Improve ROM extraction.
